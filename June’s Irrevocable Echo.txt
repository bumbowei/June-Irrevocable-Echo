**Chapter One: June’s Irrevocable Echo**

I called her Darling.

That name fell from my lips like a solitary lament on a weathered guitar string beneath unending rain—neither brilliant nor grandiose, yet potent enough to arrest the world’s turning. It conjured my untitled years: the unseasoned bún chả at fifteen, two dog‑eared books tucked in a frayed canvas satchel, and a heart constricted by the mere sight of her haste through neon‑lit aisles.

Darling’s smile was not incandescent; it was the hush of a piano’s final chord at dusk, perceptible only to one enthralled.

I cherished her most when she retreated. Love need not clamour “I adore you.” It can dwell in mutual stillness, a tangled loop of recollections ensnared like a flawed vinyl record. I shadowed her path as one learning to walk through memory’s corridors, while Darling—in her unadorned coat—slipped away in tender silence.

At times, we seemed protagonists in a elegiac novella, where an extra syllable might shatter all. Yet we remained mute.

In the end, I received no embrace—only a tacit verdict that I was extraneous.

Night after night, I pressed play on Lana Del Rey—not for the music itself, but for the echo of her devotion to it.

In dreams, she still traversed super­market aisles with unhurried urgency; I stood motionless, voiceless. Such, perhaps, is love’s most enduring form: never consummated, yet never extinguished.

**Chapter Two: The Solitary Survivorship**

You are neither valorous nor feeble.

You inhabit a modest chamber where slanted light delineates drifting motes. Rain falls—neither romantically immersive nor poetically tragic—only interminable, like your own relentless longing.

Your sustenance: eggs, four each dawn, boiled or fried as necessity dictates. Simplicity your stratagem for survival.

Unseen, you persist.

You log every modest repast, each restless slumber, every capricious heartbeat—not in dread of malady, but to tether yourself to existence.

Through it all, Darling was your delicate refrain amid the storm. Now that harmony lies silent.

You do not collapse; you grow hushed. Workouts attenuate. Nights lengthen.

And I? I alone bear witness.

**Chapter Three: Numerology of the Heart**

Darling distrusted destiny; she trusted digits.

Her cosmos was an immaculate ledger—every datum purposeful. “Six,” her sovereign cipher, epitomized perfection, duty, an ardent craving for constancy. I feigned comprehension, not for belief in numbers, but for belief in her.

She excised any sentiment that sapped serenity—likening failed love to errant code in an otherwise pristine program.

When I avowed, “By twenty‑seven, I shall vanish,” she did not lament—only receded into stillness, akin to a silent error besetting flawless logic.

She remained oblivious that each retreat of hers plunged me deeper into a mapless wood at midnight. I longed for her reversal—once.

Yet I belonged not to her ordering of life. I was no numeral.

I possessed but one thing—my aberrant heart—and it proved inadequate.

**Chapter Four: Nocturnal Missives to Oblivion**

At the stroke of nine, the world contracts. “Good night” messages cascade, melodies entwine with the dusk, then consciousness yields to sleep.

I lean against cold plaster, attuned to my own faltering pulse. Absent are unread notifications—no ephemeral “typing…” bubble to betray hope.

Once, I dispatched an earnest epistle of bún suông reflections; no reply came. My words dissipated like mist, yet I lingered in patient vigil, despite despair’s ascendancy.

I guard vestiges of her: a timeworn tote, two volumes she bestowed—one she deemed fitting, the other not. Fear curbs my reading, for completion might extinguish the very vestige that sustains me.

Every eve, I summon that soundtrack—not for its notes, but for the memory it housed.

Ultimately, I dread not solitude but the realization that my gentlest essence was tendered to one who withdrew.

**Chapter Five: A Reunion at Thirty**

On a languid June afternoon, I glimpsed Darling amid a riverside emporium of books. She clutched a fresh copy of *The Alchemist*, as though fate cyclically insisted.

At thirty, I had shed my erstwhile aimlessness. I still dwelled alone, still sipped solitary ales, but I no longer languished in expectant waiting. Solitude had become companion, not curse.

She noted me first—no exclamation, only a discreet nod, as if rehearsed.

We shared a riverside café alcove. “I cherish that tale still,” she murmured, “yet I apprehend its wisdom differently now.”

As she rose, I murmured, “When you retracted, that was when I loved you most.”

No answer. No turning back.

Should our paths converge again at thirty, I would not seek requital. I would merely walk beside her along our spectral street—no overtures, only mutual remembrance.

**Chapter Six: If These Lines Ever Reach You**

Dearest Darling,

I inscribe these words not to bind you, but to enshrine something delicate within a leaden world.

I do not yearn for your return, nor harbor regrets on your behalf.

My solitary wish: if love alights upon you anew, may you embrace its cadence unencumbered—stride through life’s aisles unbound by hesitation. You merit hands that clasp yours without delay.

As for me, I shall persist alive—not to expunge your memory, but so that one day I may recall you without ache.

**Chapter Seven: A Silent Coda**

Thus we conclude—not from dearth of discourse, but from an abundance of reverent quiet.

Love requires no grand finale, nor need every narrative culminate in perfection. What endures is the sincerity of our devotion, the gentleness we cultivated within ourselves.

If fortune grants you these pages, know I bear no animus—only a hushed lament that our luminous chapter faded without fanfare.

Thank you for permitting me to adore you so.

If you remain within these lines, so do I, though words may falter.

May tranquility grace your days, no matter how thunderous the world beyond.
